            <h2>Containment Notes:</h2>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 is to be locked within the Level 6 area of Site-342,
                encased in ██████, trapped within ██████, which is locked under
                █████████, stored within ████████, kept within a ████████ ████
                dimension ███ █████ █, “Infinity Castle”, and constantly
                monitored by Director Void 24/7. No personnel below the security
                level of the Site Council is to be allowed into SCP-10442's
                prison. Subject is to be kept isolated from any contact with any
                form of life.
            </p>
            <h2><p>Description:</p></h2>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 does not have a consistent base form. Since its
                capture in ████, it's been reported to appear as ███, ████
                ██████, ████, ████████ deer, ███ sorcerer ███████, ███ ███████
                demon, ██████████, a humanoid anglerfish with traditionally
                human female features, and other humanoid creatures with
                traditionally human female features.
            </p>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 is fully sentient and is believed to have been alive
                since the creation of the universe. It has a manipulative
                personality and believes itself to be able to create the perfect
                being. It has an extremely advanced intelligence and may be
                almost impossible to contain under normal circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 has the ability to create an infinite number of
                “monsters”. These monsters have been recorded to be very weak,
                usually. However, when these monsters are destroyed or killed,
                they will grant SCP-10442 a resistance to whatever inflicted
                their monster's death. It should be noted that this is a
                resistance and not an immunity that seems to scale off a sort of
                percentage. For example, if one of SCP-10442's monsters were to
                be killed using a bullet, SCP-10442 would gain a higher
                resistance to that specific bullet. Please note that these
                resistances do stack, and the more monsters that die in a
                specific way will grant SCP-10442 a higher resistance to said
                cause of death. At a certain point, it's believed SCP-10442
                could be virtually immune to certain causes of death.
            </p>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 can hold onto these resistances for themself, but they
                can also grant their creations its resistances as well. It is
                unclear whether or not SCP-10442 loses these resistances or if
                they hold onto them permanently. SCP-10442's monsters could
                easily be created to have a resistance to anything that the
                Foundation would be able to attack them with.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes this monster truly dangerous is its ability to adapt:
                not just to acts of violence, but to concepts themselves. It's
                been observed that while SCP-10442 seemed to slowly gain
                resistances to one specific type of item at a time, over time,
                it seemed to develop resistances to those concepts as a whole.
                For example, originally it was believed you could just kill
                SCP-10442's monsters using a certain bullet type until it gained
                full resistance, to which you would then just use a different
                kind of bullet. However, it was seen that after a certain point,
                SCP-10442 gained immunity to the concept of bullets. This was
                concerning, but it appeared that while SCP-10442 was <em
                    >immune</em
                >, its creatures were merely <em>resistant</em>. It's unclear
                whether or not SCP-10442 is able to pass this immunity onto
                other creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subject's ability to adapt to concepts is the reasoning for
                its Apollyon class rating, as it could, in theory, adapt to all
                methods of destroying and containing it.

                <p>
                    There is no threat to Site Security larger than this monster
                    here. If it were possible to be put down, we would've done
                    that a long time ago. It's our duty on the Site Council to
                    ensure the security of Site-342.

                <h3>Memo from Prof. Kenkyusha:</h3>
                <p>
                    It's an extremely interesting anomaly. Its abilities surpass
                    most of us on the Council. Now, that said, it's a threat to
                    the science and research we have dedicated ourselves to as
                    members of the Foundation. This object cannot be allowed
                    outside of its prison ever.
                </p>
                <h3>Memo from Prof. Makahawa:</h3>
                <p>
                    In my life, I've seen life and death, plenty of it. Death is
                    harsh, and it comes for all of us; there really is no
                    escaping it. Life is precious, and may be unforgiving, but
                    there is at least beauty in it. Enjoy every moment of it,
                    because it may end too soon. That's the reason this thing
                    needs to be killed. It ends life too soon. More importantly,
                    it'll end our reality's life too soon. No, death is too
                    sweet an ending for it. It's punished too many people who
                    didn't deserve it. It's killed thousands, and death is too
                    rewarding for it. IT deserves to be eternally punished, and
                    I hope we can accomplish that.

                    As much as I wish it could be reasoned with, this monster
                    has no empathy. It's a being of pure evil who is a threat to
                    life as we know it. Everything we value in life, the
                    universe itself, is at risk as long as this monster is
                    alive. For your sake, this is the time when lacking
                    compassion is the right thing to do.
