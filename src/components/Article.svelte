                SCP-10442 is to be locked within the Level 6 area of Site-342,
                encased in ██████, trapped within ██████, which is locked under
                █████████, stored within ████████, kept within a ████████ ████
                dimension ███ █████ █, “Infinity Castle”, and constantly
                monitored by Director Void 24/7. No personnel below the security
                level of the Site Council is to be allowed into SCP-10442's
                prison. Subject is to be kept isolated from any contact with any
                form of life.
            </p>
            <h2 id="description-">Description:</h2>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 does not have a consistent base form. Since its
                capture in ████, it's been reported to appear as ███, ████
                ██████, ████, ████████ deer, ███ sorcerer ███████, ███ ███████
                demon, ██████████, a humanoid anglerfish with traditionally
                human female features, and other humanoid creatures with
                traditionally human female features.
            </p>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 is fully sentient and is believed to have been alive
                since the creation of the universe. It has a manipulative
                personality and believes itself to be able to create the perfect
                being. It has an extremely advanced intelligence and may be
                almost impossible to contain under normal circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 has the ability to create an infinite number of
                “monsters”. These monsters have been recorded to be very weak,
                usually. However, when these monsters are destroyed or killed,
                they will grant SCP-10442 a resistance to whatever inflicted its
                monster's death. It should be noted that this is a resistance
                and not an immunity that seems to scale off a sort of
                percentage. For example, if one of SCP-10442's monsters were to
                be killed using a bullet, SCP-10442 would gain resistance to
                that specific bullet. Please note that these resistances do
                stack, and the more monsters that die that way will grant
                SCP-10442 a higher resistance to said cause of death. At a
                certain point, it's believed SCP-10442 could be virtually immune
                to certain causes of death.
            </p>
            <p>
                SCP-10442 can hold onto these resistances for themself, but they
                can also grant their creations it's resistances as well. It is
                unclear whether or not SCP-10442 loses these resistances or if
                they hold onto them permanently. SCP-10442's monsters could
                easily be created to one have a resistance to anything that the
                Foundation would be able to attack them with.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes this monster truly dangerous is its ability to adapt,
                not just to acts of violence, but to concepts themselves. It's
                been observed that while SCP-10442 seemed to slowly gain
                resistances to one specific type of item at a time, over time,
                it seemed to develop resistances to those concepts as a whole.
                For example, originally it was believed you could just kill
                SCP-10442's monsters using a certain bullet type until it gained
                full resistance, to which you would then just use a different
                kind of bullet. However, it was seen that after a certain point,
                SCP-10442 gained immunity to the concept of bullets. This was
                concerning, but it appeared that while SCP-10442 was immune, its
                creatures were not. Although it's unclear whether or not
                SCP-10442 was able to pass this immunity onto other creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
                The subject's ability to adapt to concepts is the reasoning for
                its Apollyon class rating, as it could, in theory, adapt to all
                methods of destroying and containing it.

            <p>
                The following is a transcript of an audio report from Site-13,
                where SCP-10442 was previously kept before being moved to
                Site-342, written by Professor ███████, the former lead
                researcher for SCP-10442.
            </p>
            <p>
                **Professor ███████ is out of breath. Alarms and screaming can
                be heard in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This is the 34th security breach that has happened since we
                captured it, and that's the second security breach today… I'm
                recording this in the event I don't make it out.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Gunshots can be heard as a warning voice announces the security
                breach over the speakers.
            </p>
            <p>
                “That thing… is a monster… It's killed anything that it's come
                into contact with… At first, we believed it could be reasoned
                with… all because it could think. That was a mistake… a mistake
                we paid dearly for. It can't be killed anymore…”
            </p>
            <p>
                The screams get louder; a faint yell can be heard from the
                distance as a splatter sound is heard.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Whoever finds this, destroy that… thing. I… I'm sorry to the
                world…”
            </p>
            <p>A distorted sound is heard before a loud squelch.**</p>
            <p>
                Professor ███████ was found in his lab with ██████ inverted,
                ██████, █████████ where ██████ should be, and █████████ missing.

                There is no threat to Site Security larger than this monster
                here. If it were possible to be put down, we would've done that
                a long time ago. It's our duty on the Site Council to ensure the
                security of Site-342.

                It's an extremely interesting anomaly. Its abilities surpass
                most of us on the Council. Now, that said, it's a threat to the
                science and research we have dedicated ourselves to as members
                of the Foundation. This object cannot be allowed outside of its
                prison ever.

                In my life, I've seen life and death, plenty of it. Death is
                harsh, and it comes for all of us; there really is no escaping
                it. Enjoy every moment of it, because it may end too soon. Well,
                too soon. That's the reason this thing needs to be killed. It
                ends life too soon. More importantly, it'll end our reality's
                well life too soon. No, death is too sweet an ending for it.
                It's punished too many people who didn't deserve it. It's killed
                thousands, and death is too nice for it. IT deserves to be
                eternally punished, and I hope we can accomplish that.

                As much as I wish it could be reasoned with, this monster has no
                empathy. It's a being of pure evil who is a threat to life as we
                know it. Everything we value in life, the universe itself, is at
                risk as long as this monster is alive.
